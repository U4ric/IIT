    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

      <hr/></div>

      <div class="PersonalInformation"><p style="text-indent:100px">Greetings  to all who seek the future. My name is Matthew Dunn, and I am an advocate for anything Technological. The fascination came at an early age growing up in the time of the Nintendo Famicom/NES as it was known in other parts of the world. Growing up in the small country of Fiji, we had limited access to anything revolutionary and relied heavily on comics, magazines, exotic retail stores, organization’s, word of mouth, radio, and the local news. Yes, we only had one channel on our broadcast network that had shared timeslots, and this was our window to the live world. The languages
      we spoke consisted primarily of English as that is what the schools
      deemed necessary to enter the modern era. Fijian is the local spoken
      language, and I am currently learning German.
    </br></br>
      My Career mainly spans across many different fields From Music entertainment to Production, Aviation to Metal work.I was someone who enjoyed the sheer thrill of working with one’s hands.This gave me the satisfaction of bringing my idea to life with a feeling of accomplishment. As an example, in the form of a custom water-cooled Personal Computer for my hobbies which consist of Music Production, Gaming and Personal Education through reading and video consumption.
      To keep fit and healthy, I attend the Gym as well as try to maintain
      lasting relationships with cherished people.</div>

    <h2>Interest in I.T.</h2>
      <div class="hr2">
      <hr/></div>
      <br/>
      <div class="MyInterestInIT">My interest in I.T. is in the field of
        Artificial  Intelligence and Robotics. I am fascinated with the future
        and there are a few movies
        that hold a special place in my heart. As an I.T. student at RMIT
        Australia, I am always getting approached by my relatives with
        recommendations in their personal experience such as Cyber Security
        and Software Developer. My interest may very well change as I am someone
        who when passionate about an industry, endeavors to be the best I can to
        master it. Even though my interest in I.T. began at a young age, I had a
        reservation within myself that stopped me from pursuing. It was mainly a
        belief in one’s abilities to grasp software systems coupled with the fact
        that I enjoyed a physical role caused me to sway in a different direction.
        It was not until the Covid-19 Pandemic hit that I was struck with the
        cold realization that I was out of the industry. That and this year felt
        like it is not a wise decision for me to be sweating for my income as
        the world gets hotter and hot as well as moves towards the future. In
        summary, job security, personal growth, and a yearning to change my
        status was the primary drive behind my shift while being fueled by fact
        that the world will be vastly different in 2050. My I.T. experience is
        basic; however, I tend to learn, enjoy troubleshooting to help customers
        and solve problems. I pride myself on delivering quality.
        <br/><br/>

        I enrolled at RMIT by the display of the I.T. Graduates that were
          featured in the videos I witnessed. I believed every word that RMIT
          is responsible for many of the leading industry professionals.
          The ability to conduct the entire course online was also one of my
          deciding factors as I work fulltime to support this course and my
          life.

          I expect to learn the key fundamentals on how to be Professional
            in an environment where discipline, accuracy, quality and especially
            teamwork which are essential to being successful in this field. To
            learn how make myself scalable in the industry by constantly
            educating myself and thus moving through the ranks to maximize my
            skill and potential.</div>

      <h2>Job Needs</h2>
        <div class="hr3">
        <hr/></div>

      <h3><u>Position and Appeal</u></h3>

        <p>I believe the position of Software Developer involves the broad knowledge and ability to understand simple and complex Programming languages that establish communication between the code and the computer’s ability to read said code. The position involves interfacing in a team and is a vital role to the smooth operation of the company’s customer base. Quality must always be at the forefront of any software release through constant communication and testing. I find this career fascinating as you are a key member to the company with knowledge that is scalable. You hold a responsibility to your company and the customers trust in your deliverance of a quality product.</p>

      <h3><u>Skills Required</u></h3>

        <p>The key skills of a Software Developer are to have solid foundation of the fundamentals in advanced coding languages. The ability to troubleshoot and deal with conflict amongst the software itself and the team members that manage the software. A strong passion for Technology and willingness to advance one’s skillset is a must. Finally, experience in the field of information Technology and exposure to industry professionals, Qualifications in I.T. such as a Bachelor of I.T., Programming Languages such as C#, React.JS and self-taught learning is considered.</p>

      <h3><u>Skills I Possess</u></h3>

        <p>This is the tricky part. A Software Developers position takes many years of progression as I have skills from totally different industries. There is one common skill that is similar among many and the lifeblood to a successful company and that is Teamwork. The ability to self-educate as well as the passion to succeed.</p>

      <h3><u>Skills I will Obtain</u></h3>

        <p>I have already begun on my journey to understanding the I.T. sector by undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology degree. In my spare time I am beginning to look at programming languages to supply the knowledge required and for my own mastery. I will obtain the experience I need to work as a team by experiencing it firsthand in my group-based assignments. I understand that a Software Developers career entails a lot of responsibility and hard work, so I am willing to enter entry level positions to gain experience.</p>

      <h3><u>Myers-Briggs Learning Outcome</u></h3>

        <p>According to the Myers-Briggs type indicator, I have the personality of a Defender. A scary yet quite accurate description as I do possess some of those attributes. I tend to help others, yet at the same time appreciate my own creative time.</p>

      <h3><u>Meaning</u></h3>

        <p>A defenders strengths include being supportive in the endeavour to help others while being patient and understand of people’s separate lives. I believe that with the somewhat base accuracy of the Myers-Briggs test analysis, the outcome can be used as a basis for improvement on the discoveries made on my strengths and weaknesses.</p>

      <h3><u>Behavioural Influence</u></h3>

        <p>These results of the test should inspire positivity as the key fundamentals that make up my strengths are present. However, on a relative note, for every pro there is a con and as mentioned by the test, advantage can be taken with some negatives being present.</p>

      <h3><u>Accountability</u></h3>

        <p>As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than cure and this leads me to believe that I must go into this project as a strong individual but also respectful of my team. To consider other colleges input and to work together to brainstorm, test and deliver a quality final product.</p>

        <center><img src="Learning Style Test Pie Chart (PersonalityMax).png"></centre>

        <p>The learning style test I chose offered by <a href="https://personalitymax.com/" target="_blank"> PersonalityMax</a> indicates that my primary form of learning is by visual, followed closely by Auditory and Kinesthetics which involves the art of doing which is odd because it the primary focus on the industry I have been working in. As with tests like these, it must be taken with a grain of salt which means sometimes it is a rough estimation on one’s thinking patterns at the time and can be derived from a particular mood the person is in while taking the test. I believe in the end that we make our own destiny and how much effort we put it, yields results.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>According to my Creativity Test conducted at <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/" target="_blank">TestMyCreativity</a>, I rank in the curious category. One that has a desire to change the norm. This fits me in a way as I am always striving to improve myself. This can be a good and bad thing as you sometimes can become your own worst enemy through procrastination via being a perfectionist and it is one of my weaknesses, I am working on to improve so that I can enhance the speed of my tasks.</p>

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <div class="hr4">
        <hr/></div>
        <br/>

      <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>

        <p>I wish to implement a piece of software in the form of an App for mobiles and Desktop computer giving the user the ability to get their music played in Nightclubs directly, among other capabilities, with a pass in rigorous screening processes for quality.</p>

      <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>

        <p>My Project idea would have to come from an industry that I understand a little more in depth, and that is the Music Industry. Being a DJ as a weekend job, brought me many connections and while my brief time as a Music Producer and still having access to the software and hardware to create said music, there were certain tools I wish had been around for ease the release schedules</p>

      <h3><u>Description</u></h3>

        <p>My idea would exist in the form of a Mobile App and Desktop counterpart to reach out to as many devices as possible. I yearn for the capability of the Producers music being played directly by DJs in Nightclubs. Tracks that have gone through a screening process by a team of professionals for Stereo Imaging, uniqueness and excitability would make the cut as an example. Every time the DJ would play the track, the Producer would directly get royalties for each play as well as the DJ taking a percentage of the funds. The model would be subscription based with offerings for yearly discounts to keep the App maintained and company afloat. The software would read that the track has been played by either the controller on the Deck (DJ control device), connecting the mobile wirelessly or wired to the Deck itself, thus resulting in the Software knowing that its version is being streamed or used to the device. The App would have the capability to download the tracks if a poor streaming connection is foreseen. The App/Desktop version would integrate Vocalists, Musicians and Producers with the ability to collaborate on Productions together through a separate section within the software. The same goes for live gigs as I would implement an area for people to list their parties, nightclubs to list their gigs and major events to be listed, all verified of course. This is a way of bringing the whole Music community together and easing the life of a freelancer.
        </p>
      <h3><u>Tools and Technologies</u></h3>

        <p>The programming code needed to create the software would be along the lines of Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Swift and Python. The hardware devices would be Android and IOS devices, covering PC and Mac systems.</p>

      <h3><u>Skills Required</u></h3>

        <p>Design Teams, Software Developers, Administration, I.T. Helpdesk Support, Sales Teams, Assistants, Quality Control, Managers and Marketing teams to maintain the company on a large scale. Design teams would need to draft an idea around the UI and layout of the software, including the color scheme. A complex understanding of programming, testing, troubleshooting would be needed to get the software built from the ground up. Administration would be running all the duties and interfacing with the client’s needs. Helpdesk will be required to tend to any Hardware related I.T. problems as well as tending to customers’ needs in terms of technical support. Managers and Marketing teams will be responsible in advertising the product for consumer use.</p>

      <h3><u>Outcome</u></h3>

        <p>With the success of the project in the long term, I would like to take the software to infinite scalability, investing in more company solutions, workplace stress-free environments for the employees and where the business becomes a household name. Software that Audio Enthusiasts worldwide will thoroughly be satisfied and forever grateful for creating a piece of Technology that revolutionized the Industry. A piece of software that brought ease of use and peace of mind to supporting the dreams of anyone who wanted to make Music their full-time career and was told it was not feasible. Someone that will settle for nothing less than their passion.</p>
